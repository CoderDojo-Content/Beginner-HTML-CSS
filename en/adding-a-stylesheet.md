1. Look
2. Go to the file myFirstStyles.css
3. there is the text h1 followed by a pair of curly braces with some text in between.
4. Notice there is some text in between curly braces {} with the text h1 in front
5. The curly braces and the text in between them is a set of rules. The "h1" means that the set of rules is for the &lt;h1&gt; tags on your web page. We call the bit outside the curly braces a selector. So in this case, it is the selector for the h1 tags.
6. Change the color to "blue"
7. Look what happens to your webpage.
8. Do I show how to add the link or do I just include it and say nothing, or do I include it and give it a mention....

9. Let's change the style of the paragraphs.

10. \(code for p tag with font colour or size or family or something\)

11. Finally lets change the background colour of the web page. For this we will need the "body" selector. Remember the &lt;body&gt; tag defines the whole page.
