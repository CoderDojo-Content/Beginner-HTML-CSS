\(may merge into "adding more pages"\)

1. Lets start with a homepage. Every website needs a homepage! This is the first page you land on when you visit a website.
2. Click on the tab where it says "MyFirstPage.html"
3. Change the text so that it says "index.html" instead. When the browser sees a page called "index.html", it knows that this is the homepage for a website.
4. Now, click on the + next to the tabs. This will create a new file, which will be a new page. Give it a name.
5. Go to the file BlankPage.html by clicking on the tab that says BlankPage.html This is a template that you can use for all your pages. 
6. Select all of the text on the page. 
   1. Click anywhere inside the BlankPage.html file
   2. Press and hold the Ctrl key, or if you are using a Mac, the cmd key, and while holding it, press the A key at the same time. Notice how all the text becomes selected \[screenshot\]
7. So you've got a homepage and a few additional pages, but how do you get to the other pages? You need to create links! Lets add the link tag to the items in your list of pages.
8. Just in front of the text in between the list item tags &lt;li&gt; &lt;/li&gt; , place

Find the `<title>` and `</title>` tags, and change the text in between them to give your page a new title.
