1. In the code window on the left, click on the tab that says "index.html".
2. Find the line that says "Welcome to Ireland!" and change it to your own home country or town, being careful not to delete the text `<p>` at the start of the line and `</p>` at the end of the line. Then click on the button that says "Click To Run". This is the Run button. You will see your web page updated in the right hand panel.
3. Now on the same line, change the `<p>` and `</p>` to `<h1>` and `</h1>`, and click Run. What happens?
4. When you want to put text on a page, you need to put it in between two **tags** that tell your browser how to display your text. For example, the `<p>` tag tells the browser it is a paragraph of text. The `<h1>` tag tells it that the text is a heading.
   * A **browser** is the program you use to look at websites, for example Chrome or Firefox.
5. Why do you need two tags? You have an **opening** and a **closing** tag to tell the browser where things start and end. So for a paragraph, the opening `<p>` tag tag says "here comes some text that I want you to display as a paragraph". The closing `</p>` tag tells the browser where the paragraph ends. Everything in between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags is your web page. 
   * Notice how the** closing **tag always has a forward slash, `/`.
6. Try changing the `h1` to `h2`. Remember to change it in both the **opening** `<h1>` and the **closing** `</h1>` tag.
7. Find the `<title>` and `</title>` tags and change the text in between them, to give your page a title.
8. Lets download your code and look at it! At the top left corner of the code window, click on the menu icon that looks like three lines, and click Download.
9. Your project will be downloaded as a zip file, containing all the files for your website. Open up the zip file.
10. Find the file called index.html. Double click on it to open it up in a **browser**. Can you the title you gave the page, at the top of the tab or window?
11. Go back to the list of files and find index.html again. This time right click it \(to "right click" on a Mac, either click and hold, or click with two fingers!\), select Open With &gt; and choose a plain text editor such as Notepad, Notepad++ or Sublime Text. You should see all the tags, like in the code window on Trinket.
12. So a web page is just made up of text, with tags to control it! The web page and the code are the same file: depending on whether you open it in a browser or a plain text editor, you will see either the code \(text and tags\) or the web page \(just text\).
