1. In the code window on the left, click on the tab that says "index.html".
2. Find the line that says "Welcome to Ireland!" and change it to your own home country or town, being careful not to delete the text `<p>` at the start of the line and `</p>` at the end of the line. Then click on the button that says "Click To Run". This is the Run button. You will see your web page updated in the right hand panel.
3. Now on the same line, change the `<p>` and `</p>` to `<h1>` and `</h1>`, and click Run. What happens?
4. When you want to put text on a page, you need to put it in between two tags that tell the browser how to display your text. For example, the `<p>` tag tells the browser it is a paragraph of text. The `<h1>` tag tells it that the text is a heading.
5. Try changing the
6. Why do you need two tags? You need an **opening** and a **closing** tag to tell the browser where things start and end. So for a paragraph, the opening `<p>` tag tag says "here comes some text that I want you to display as a paragraph". The closing `</p>` tag tells the browser where the paragraph ends. Everything in between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags is your web page. 
7. So a web page is just made up of text, with tags to control it!

1. The pieces of code at the start and end of the line are called **tags**. When you want to put text on a page, you need to put it in between two **tags** that tell the browser how to display your text. The end tag always has a forward slash, `/`. It is called the **closing** tag, and the matching tag at the start of the line is called the **opening** tag.
   1. A **browser** is the program you use to look at websites, for example Chrome or Firefox.
2. All web pages are made up of text, with tags controlling how it appears on the page. Can you find the `<body>` and `</body>` tags? They define the start and end of the page.

1. 
2. mention the body tag. says it's the "page" i.e. everything in between the body tags is the contents of your page

3. When you want to put text on a page, you need to put it in between two tags that tell the browser how to display your text. For example, the &lt;p&gt; tag tells the browser it is a paragraph of text. The &lt;h1&gt; tag tells it that the text is a heading.

   1. try changing it to h2!

4. Why two tags? You need an opening and a closing tag to tell the browser where things start and end. So for a paragraph, the opening &lt;p&gt; tag tag says "here comes some text that I want you to display as a paragraph". The closing &lt;/p&gt; tag tells the browser where the paragraph ends. Notice how all closing tags are the same as the opening tag, but with a / at the start.

5. Also notice the &lt;title&gt; tag. This says what the title of the page is, and is the text you see at the top of the browser window \(is that even visible on trinket?!\)
