1. In the code window on the left, click on the tab that says "my-first-page.html"
2. 1st page is p and h tags

3. Explain what "tags" are

4. mention the body tag. says it's the "page" i.e. everything in between the body tags is the contents of your page

5. When you want to put text on a page, you need to put it in between two tags that tell the browser how to display your text. For example, the &lt;p&gt; tag tells the browser it is a paragraph of text. The &lt;h1&gt; tag tells it that the text is a heading.

   1. try changing it to h2!

6. Why two tags? You need an opening and a closing tag to tell the browser where things start and end. So for a paragraph, the opening &lt;p&gt; tag tag says "here comes some text that I want you to display as a paragraph". The closing &lt;/p&gt; tag tells the browser where the paragraph ends. Notice how all closing tags are the same as the opening tag, but with a / at the start.

7. Also notice the &lt;title&gt; tag. This says what the title of the page is, and is the text you see at the top of the browser window \(is that even visible on trinket?!\)
