1. In the panel on the left, the **code panel**, click on the tab that says "index.html".
2. Find the line that says "Welcome to Ireland!" and change it to your own home country or town, being careful not to delete the text `<p>` at the start of the line and `</p>` at the end of the line. Then click on the button that says "Click To Run". This is the Run button. You will see your web page updated in the right hand panel.
3. Now on the same line, change the `<p>` and `</p>` to `<h1>` and `</h1>`, and click Run. What happens?
4. When you want to put text on a page, you need to put it in between two **tags** that tell your browser how to display your text. For example, the `<p>` tag tells the browser it is a paragraph of text. The `<h1>` tag tells it that the text is a heading.
   * A **browser** is the program you use to look at websites, for example Chrome or Firefox.
   * The **.html** in the filename tells the browser that the file is a web page, so it looks for the tags telling it what to display. **HTML** is the code that makes a web page.
5. Why do you need two tags? You have an **opening** and a **closing** tag to tell the browser where things start and end. So for a paragraph, the opening `<p>` tag tag says "here comes some text that I want you to display as a paragraph". The closing `</p>` tag tells the browser where the paragraph ends. Everything in between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags is your web page. 
   * Notice how the** closing **tag always has a forward slash, `/`.
   * The different pieces of a page defined by tags, for example paragraphs and headings, or the body, are called **elements**.

6. Try changing the `p` to `h2` in the last paragraph, the one that says "Coding websites is fun!" Remember to change it in both the **opening** `<p>` and the **closing** `</p>` tag.
7. Find the `<title>` and `</title>` tags and change the text in between them to "Home". Then click the run button. ![](/assets/FirstTagsAndRun.png)
8. Click the blue Save button at the top right to save your changes.
9. So a web page is just made up of text, with tags to control it!
 * You have `p` tags for paragraphs and `h` tags for headings. Try adding some more headings, changing the numbers in your tags to see the different sizes you get! They can go from `<h1>` all the way up to `<h6>`. Add some more text in between new `<p> </p>` tags too if you want!
