1. So you've decided what pages you'd like to have in your website, now let's make them! To create a new web page, you create a new file with a name that ends in **.html**. At the top of the code window, click on the + symbol next to the tabs. This will create a new file. Give it a name. Remember, it must end in **.html** \(including the dot!\) so that the browser knows it's a web page!
   * If you want to change the name of a file, click on the cog icon to the right of the filename, and click the pencil. Type in the new name and press Enter. You can also delete a file by clicking the bin icon instead of the pencil.![](/assets/newfileedit.png)
2. You might be wondering why you can't change the name of the index.html file. "index.html" is a special name used for the homepage of a website. The homepage is the first page you land on when you visit a website. When you visit a website's homepage, the browser looks for the file called "index.html" and displays it on your screen.
3. Go the the file blank\_page.html in the code window \(by clicking on the tab with that name\). Select all of the text in the code window by doing the following: Click anywhere inside the code window, then press and hold the **Ctrl** key \(or if you are using a Mac, the **cmd** key\) and while holding it, press the **A** key at the same time. Notice how all the text becomes selected.![](/assets/AllSelected.png)
4. Now, with the text selected, press and hold the Ctrl \(or cmd\) key again and then while holding it press the **C** key. This copies everything that was selected.
5. Go to your new file and click inside the code window \(which is blank at the moment\). Press and hold the Ctrl \(or cmd\) key and then while holding it, press the **V** key. This **pastes** everything that was copied into your new page.
6. Change the text in between the `<title> </title>` tags so your new page has the right title.
7. In between the `<body> </body>` tags in the new file, use the tags you have learned to add stuff to the page, such as paragraphs, headings, images and lists!
8. Repeat the steps above for each new page that you want to add. 
9. When there are too many tabs to be able to see them al, you can use the **<** and **>** icons in the top left corner of the tabs to scroll between them.
