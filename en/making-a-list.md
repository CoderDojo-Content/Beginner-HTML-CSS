1. Wouldn't it be nice if the list of pages looked more like a list? Well, there are html tags that do just that! Go back to the tab named index.html and change the paragraph code so that it looks like this: 
   ```
    <p>
       My website is about Ireland. It is going to have the following pages:
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li>Attractions</li>
       <li>Music</li>
       <li>Food</li>
    </ul>
   ```
2. Click Run. See how the text got put into a nice list?

3. The `<ul> </ul>` tags go around the whole list, and they turn it into the nice looking list you now have. "ul" stands for **unordered list**. This means a list with no numbers. Each thing in the list must be between `<li> </li>` tags. "li" stands for **list item**. Change the list items to some pages that you would like to have in your website!

4. How about if you wanted a numbered list? It's almost the same, but instead of `ul`, you use `ol`, which stands for **ordered list**. Add the following code after the last `</p>` tag in the file:

   ```
   <p>
      These are the things I have learned to use in my website so far:
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>Headings</li>
      <li>Paragraphs</li>
      <li>A stylesheet</li>
      <li>Lists!</li>
   </ol>
   ```

5. Click Run. Here's what it should look like now: \[SCREENSHOT\]
