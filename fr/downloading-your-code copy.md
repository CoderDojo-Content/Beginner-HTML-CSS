1. Lets download your code and look at it! At the top left corner of the code window, click on the menu icon that looks like three lines, and click Download. 
2. A zip file will be downloaded. It contains all the files for your website. 
3. Open up the zip file and find the file called index.html. Double click on it to open it up in a **browser**. Can you see the title you gave the page, at the top of the tab or window?
4. Leave the browser window open, and go back to the window with the list of files. Find index.html again. This time right click it \(to "right click" on a Mac, either click and hold, or click with two fingers!\), select Open With &gt; and choose a plain text editor such as Notepad, Notepad++ or Sublime Text. You should see all the tags, like in the code window on Trinket.
5. As you know, a web page is just made up of text, with tags to control it. Now you can see that the web page and the code are in fact the same file: depending on whether you open it in a browser or a plain text editor, you will see either the code \(text and tags\) or the web page \(just text\).
