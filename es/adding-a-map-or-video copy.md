1. Bonus: add a map! Go to maps.google.com and search for a place you want to show on your website. Once you have got a result, find the "Share" button and click it. Select the option "Embed".
2. You will see a textbox with all the text selected \(if you accidentally unselect the text, you can select it all again by clicking on it and pressing the Ctrl and A keys together on your keyboard, just like before\). Press the Ctrl and C keys together on your keyboard to copy the text.
3. Then go your code window, and click in the place where you want to put the map, for example below a closing &lt;/p&gt; tag. Paste the code by pressing Ctrl and V on your keyboard at the same time, just like before. Don't worry about understanding all the code you just pasted! Click Run to see the map appear on your web page.
4. If you look carefully you should be able to find a`width`attribute in the pasted code. You can change its value to make the map appear bigger or smaller.
5. The same technique works for YouTube videos as well. Give it a go!
